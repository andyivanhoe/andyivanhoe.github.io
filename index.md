## Andy Symonds - Data Science Portfolio

I enjoy the whole data science process, from getting stuck in understanding the data with some 'munging', to building machine learning models and deploying them for consumption. Machine learning models are only good if they get used and continue to serve the purpose they were designed for, so continuous integration and deployment and MLOps is essential.

### Overview

Exploratory data analysis

Build and deploy machine learning models in Python or R

Design & deploy Shiny dashboards to visualise data and consume ML models

Azure & Azure Data Scientist Associate, Microsoft Certification

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment with GitHub Actions

MLOps

Testing for robust code


### Models

Thanks to Terence Shin for the nice article clearly explaining the grouping of the different types of models. Look his article up here: https://towardsdatascience.com/all-machine-learning-algorithms-you-should-know-in-2022-db5b4ccdf32f

Build and deploy machine learning models in Python or R
1. Ensemble learning algorithms
    - Random Forest
    - XGBoost
    - LightGBM
    - CatBoost

2. Explanatory algorithms
    - Linear regression
    - Logistic regression
    - SHAP - a method used to interpret ML models
    - LIME - a method used to interpret ML models

3. Clustering algoritms
    - k-menas clustering
    - Hierarchical clustering

4. Dimensionality Reduction algorithms
   Comparisons found at: https://towardsdatascience.com/dimensionality-reduction-for-data-visualization-pca-vs-tsne-vs-umap-be4aa7b1cb29
    - Principal components analysis (PCA)
    - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
    - tSNE
    - UMAP 

5. Similarity algorithms
    - K nearest neighbours
    - Euclidian distance
    - Cosine similarity
    - Levenshtein algorithm
    - Jaro-Winkler algorithm
    - Singular Value Decomposition (SVM) - indirectly relates to similarity
