## Andy Symonds - Data Science Portfolio

I enjoy the whole data science process, from getting stuck in to understanding the data with some 'munging', to building machine learning models and deploying them for consumption. Machine learning models are only good if they get used and continue to serve the purpose they were designed for, so continuous integration and deployment and MLOps is essential.

### Overview        #TODO: Make these hyperlinks to the correct section

[Set-up](#set-up)

Exploratory data analysis

Build and deploy machine learning models in Python or R

Design & deploy Shiny dashboards to visualise data and consume ML models

Azure & Azure Data Scientist Associate, Microsoft Certification

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment with GitHub Actions

MLOps

Testing for robust code

### Set-up
Currently, I like to use VS Code when writing Python and RStudio when writing R/Shiny. I use a MacBook Pro mid-2014, which is still going strong. For heavy ML model training use Google Colaboratory.

### Exploratory data analysis

#TODO: List common things to consider

### Models

Thanks to Terence Shin for the nice article clearly explaining the grouping of the different types of models. Look his article up here: https://towardsdatascience.com/all-machine-learning-algorithms-you-should-know-in-2022-db5b4ccdf32f

Build and deploy machine learning models in Python or R

#TODO: Complete DP-100 so that I can link a badge to here (or at least to my LinkedIn that can show the badge

### CI-CD & MLOps


### Future additions
    - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANS)
    - Reinforcement learning (CV)
    - Linear programming and optiization using Pyomo
