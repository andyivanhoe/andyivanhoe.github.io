## Andy Symonds - Data Science Portfolio

I enjoy the whole data science process, from getting stuck in to understanding the data with some 'munging', to building machine learning models and deploying them for consumption. Machine learning models are only good if they get used and continue to serve the purpose they were designed for, so continuous integration and deployment and MLOps is essential.

### Overview

[Set-up](#set-up)

[Exploratory data analysis](#exploratory data analysis)

[Build and deploy machine learning models in Python or R](#models)

[Design & deploy Shiny dashboards to visualise data and consume ML models](#shiny dashboards)

[Microsoft Azure](#microsoft azure)

[Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment with GitHub Actions](#ci-cd & mlops)

MLOps

Testing for robust code

### Set-up
Currently, I like to use VS Code when writing Python and RStudio when writing R/Shiny. I use a MacBook Pro mid-2014, which is still going strong. For heavy ML model training use Google Colaboratory.

### Exploratory data analysis

#TODO: List common things to consider

### Models

Thanks to Terence Shin for the nice article clearly explaining the grouping of the different types of models. Look his article up here: https://towardsdatascience.com/all-machine-learning-algorithms-you-should-know-in-2022-db5b4ccdf32f

Build and deploy machine learning models in Python or R
1. Ensemble learning algorithms
    - Random Forest     #TODO: https://towardsdatascience.com/random-forest-in-python-24d0893d51c0
    - XGBoost
    - LightGBM
    - CatBoost

2. Explanatory algorithms
    - Linear regression
    - Logistic regression
    - SHAP - a method used to interpret ML models   #TODO: https://towardsdatascience.com/shap-a-reliable-way-to-analyze-your-model-interpretability-874294d30af6
    - LIME - a method used to interpret ML models   #TODO: https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-model-predictions-with-lime-a582fdff3a3b

3. Clustering algoritms
    - K-menas clustering. #TODO: https://machinelearningmastery.com/clustering-algorithms-with-python/
    - Hierarchical clustering

4. Dimensionality Reduction algorithms
   Comparisons found at: https://towardsdatascience.com/dimensionality-reduction-for-data-visualization-pca-vs-tsne-vs-umap-be4aa7b1cb29
   
    - Principal components analysis (PCA)   #TODO: Google 'PCA projects python' some good hits
    - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
    - tSNE
    - UMAP 

5. Similarity algorithms
    - K nearest neighbours
    - Euclidian distance
    - Cosine similarity
    - Levenshtein algorithm
    - Jaro-Winkler algorithm
    - Singular Value Decomposition (SVM) - indirectly relates to similarity

### Neural Networks & Deep Learning

#TODO: Upload some of my notebooks from Tensorflow training

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
#TODO: Upload some of my notebooks from NLP training

### Knowledge Graphs

https://towardsdatascience.com/knowledge-graph-bb78055a7884

#TODO: Make a knowledge graph in neo4j of brain regions --> and how they compare between different species, perhaps gene networks of polarity
One exists already: https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/845976

#TODO: May combine with NLP in future


### Shiny Dashboards


### Microsoft Azure

#TODO: Complete DP-100 so that I can link a badge to here (or at least to my LinkedIn that can show the badge

### CI-CD & MLOps


### Future additions
    - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANS)
    - Reinforcement learning (CV)
    - Linear programming and optiization using Pyomo
    - Computer Visions (Mask-RCNN)
